### Roadmap
We have a few improvements planned

1. Sub 20 second load time (even on Kaggle). 
2. Scientific entity formatting using **scispacy** and **displacy**
3. Specific information extraction and question answering e.g. *what is the incubation period of coronavirus*?
4. Non-notebook user interface
